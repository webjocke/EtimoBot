# EtimoBot
A bot for the **Etimo diamonds competition** written in Python. The competition Etimo Diamonds where held for student of the univerity in Link√∂ping, Sweden. The goal where to get most amount of diamonds in one minute. A combination of the algoritms I made (/src/game/logic), got me to place **5** on the score board.

Thanks to *Arty* for some of the `main.py` code that make the bot go faster!

## How did it work?
Basiclly you had access to an api that you could send requests to move your player move though the map. The respons to your request is always the way the board looked at the time of the request.

## My files
I only included the files that I have changed/created in the /src folder. Download the example files from the official Etimo repo ([here](https://github.com/Etimo/diamonds/tree/master/diamonds-bot-example)) and insert my files in the right folders and you should be able to run the bot using the play_linuxMac.sh or play_windows.bat depending on your OS. You might need python/python3 installed and in your path.
